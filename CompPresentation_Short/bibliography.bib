    abstract = { We consider the optimal control problem of determining electromagnetic pulses for implementing logical gates in a closed quantum system, where the Hamiltonian models the dynamics of coupled superconducting qudits. The quantum state is governed by Schrödinger's equation, which we formulate in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the state vector and solve by the Störmer--Verlet scheme, which is a symplectic partitioned Runge--Kutta method. A novel parameterization of the control functions based on B-splines with carrier waves is introduced. The carrier waves are used to trigger the resonant frequencies in the system Hamiltonian, and the B-spline functions specify their amplitude and phase. This approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and significantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating Schrödinger's equation. We present numerical examples of how the proposed technique can be combined with an interior point limited memory BFGS algorithm for realizing quantum gates and generalize our approach to calculate risk-neutral controls that are resilient to noise in the Hamiltonian model. The proposed method is also shown to compare favorably with QuTiP/pulse\_optim and Grape-TensorFlow. }

abstract = {Matrix-product states have become the de facto standard for the representation of one-dimensional quantum many body states. During the last few years, numerous new methods have been introduced to evaluate the time evolution of a matrix-product state. Here, we will review and summarize the recent work on this topic as applied to finite quantum systems. We will explain and compare the different methods available to construct a time-evolved matrix-product state, namely the time-evolving block decimation, the MPO WI,II method, the global Krylov method, the local Krylov method and the one- and two-site time-dependent variational principle. We will also apply these methods to four different representative examples of current problem settings in condensed matter physics.}

abstract = {The density-matrix renormalization group method (DMRG) has established itself over the last decade as the leading method for the simulation of the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional strongly correlated quantum lattice systems. In the further development of the method, the realization that DMRG operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the DMRG method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current DMRG thinking in the MPS language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of DMRG algorithms in exclusively MPS terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while DMRG is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.}
